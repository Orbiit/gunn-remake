# Gunn Remake
Using only HTML and CSS (because we're too lazy to deal with JavaScript), we're going to make the [Gunn Website](http://gunn.pausd.org/) from scratch

There's a template design that will be the standard design for most of the pages which you can preview [here](https://velosify.github.io/gunn-remake/templates/t01.html).

There's also the [second template](https://velosify.github.io/gunn-remake/templates/t02.html). Then we combined the first two to make [this mess](https://velosify.github.io/gunn-remake/templates/t03.html).
